This is my personal project to streamline new workstation onboarding processes.
Converted originally from PowerShell to Csharp, and uses MahApps and WPF for UI.

Automation and consistency was the goal - instead of doing the multitude of steps manually, I created this app to automate those steps, which also has the added effect of making each workstation I onboard consistently the exact same setup.
This should elimiate any configuration drift that sometimes happens when doing it manually - (missing or fogetting a step, for example).
Also, this saves setup time per workstation. This app is not model specific, it will work across any model workstation.
