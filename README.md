This is my personal project to streamline new workstation onboarding processes.

Automation and consistency was the goal - instead of doing the multitude of steps manually, I created this app to automate those steps, which also has the added effect of making each workstation I onboard consistently the exact same setup.
This elimiated any configuration drift that sometimes happens when doing it manually - (missing or fogetting a step, for example).
Also, this saves setup time per workstation.

Converted originally from PowerShell to Csharp, and uses MahApps and WPF for UI.
