20250709: Didn't keep this up-to-date during testing and bug fixing - final working version published.
--Current version requires internet to get a few installers - thinking of bundling that all in possibly.

20250824: Refactored to extract Baseline Service to its own class library project - and its own tab.
--Also refactored Uninstaller service to a third button in the Uninstall tab that purges all Dell software that the first pass doesn't get.
--Also added a few more Dell packages to the Uninstall list.
