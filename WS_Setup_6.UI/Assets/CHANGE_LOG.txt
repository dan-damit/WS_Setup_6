---D3DCompiler_47_cor3.dll
---Other various dll dependencies

--Services
---BaselineService.cs
---OnboardService.cs
---UninstallService.cs

--The various xaml and xmal.cs


20250709: Didn't keep this up-to-date during testing and bug fixing - final working version published.
--Current version requires internet to get a few installers - thinking of bundling that all in possibly.

20250824: Refactored to extract Baseline Service to its own class library project - and its own tab.
--Also refactored Uninstaller service to a third button in the Uninstall tab that purges all Dell software that the first pass doesn't get.
--Also added a few more Dell packages to the Uninstall list.

20250826: Changed build-time to exclude Assets content in the single-file exe to speed up cold starts on new workstations
--Also updated Bootstrapper script to copy the assets to C:\Working to avoid issues with codebase looking for Assets at runtime.
--Also changed name of Bootstrapper.exe to Setup.exe

----Refactored everything to remove SingleFile to reduce file size and complexity.
----Adjusted Bootstrapper script to copy the Assets folder to C:\Working\Assets
----Adjusted code to look for Assets in C:\Working\Assets
----Using NSIS to create a single installer exe from a .zip of Publish that extracts everything to C:\Working and runs Setup.exe from there.
----Adjusted to just include English language for now to reduce complexity.

--Ditched the NSIS route and uploaded AcroRdrInstaller.exe to a web location to reduce complexity and file size.
----github.com releases hosts the large AcroRdrInstaller.exe file.
----Refactored the Adobe installer to download from the web location instead of looking in Assets.

20250827: This evening will research using WiX and remove the PublishSingleFile settings.
--Refactored Uninstaller logic based on the log file from the last run on a Dell machine.
--Working now on WiX project - still a work in progress.

20250828: WiX project is starting to take shape - still a work in progress.
--Lots of trial and error - learning as I go on WiX.
